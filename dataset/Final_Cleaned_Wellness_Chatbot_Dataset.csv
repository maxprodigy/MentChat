People in the company have a self-centered side .,I don't think it's bad to think about myself first.
It's a bit self-centered.,"You can take care of you, I think it's good."
There is a self-centered side.,"Oh, yes."
The original personality is independent.,"Okay, I think it's very cool."
"Even if it's hard, I don't lean on or speak to others.",It's really nice to have a lot of things you can do alone well.
Siazu Bunny was a problem.,"Oh, really?"
So we lived with our parents in law.,Okay.
There was a grandmother at the beginning of the wedding .,"Yes, please tell me more."
My boyfriend's mother is like a crazy Psycho Torai.,I think it's hard to get along with people with poetry .
You don't pay for tuition for me?,"I think you were hurt a lot, are you okay?"
I'm blocked all day long by my mother-in-law .,You must have a lot of trouble.
How good is that old man raising people?,It would be nice to have anyone to mediate. My heart hurts.
I wanted to go out and live separately and lived with my brother and Siazuni because of the lack of situation.,That's why it must be a lot of frustration.
"Ajou had received hundreds of millions of loans, but it turns out that my dad is paying back the money!",I hope that it will be resolved quickly.
Ajoubus' situation seems to be very difficult.,I will listen until my heart is released.
"This time I do a cafe Alba, but I work together at the same time.","Yes, you are diligent."
"It wasn't originally, but it's like this since I was a convenience store.",I think it's good to be able to spend a part-time job every day .
I was introduced to Alba teaching English to the babies .,Did you always cheer?
I raised a cat called Mori.,That happened.
Can a cat be quills?,Please stop by.
"My brother or mother didn't like it and opposed it, but I was just raising it at home.","You must have been great, it's like a family."
"I went home late at night while studying the exam, but there is no Mori.",You must have been sorry for your family.
"I feel something weird because I feel something weird, so how do you keep a ferocious child?",I also feel frustrated...
"When I was young, my mom went out for a while and I woke up in between.",Yes. Okay. What happened?
In elementary school I was taller and maturer than other kids .,I think there are memories that are not forgotten even if they were so intense . So what happened?
It would have been in the second year of elementary school and my mom seems to have been lying at home .,"Yes, I'm listening, please talk more."
"When I was young, my family was really bad.",You said I must have had a lot of trouble when I was young .
"In the narrow rooms, six family members lived in three brothers and sisters .","If that happens, you can get rid of it. I'm glad you have been well."
"When I was young, my house didn't live so well.",You spent such a childhood.
My girlfriend has been meeting in Pohang for about two years .,"Oh, yes."
I knew my girlfriend with me.,You are in love.
I didn't want to fall with my girlfriend.,Are you worried about your girlfriend?
Is it because it's a distant love? I don't feel psychologically close.,I think you have a lot of trouble because of love.
"I have a girlfriend for two years, others say this is a deep relationship .",I think there are various types of love .
So I first set up my girlfriend in Incheon.,I hope you can see each other for a long time.
And I came up to Incheon and started living with my girlfriend .,"I think it's good to live together, what about?"
"In the end, I live with my girlfriend.",I think you are happy.
It's been three years since I broke up with my girlfriend .,"You must have a lot of heart, I think I need time to be sad enough."
"But after a month, I don't think it's no matter how much she meets me. So I let go.","One day there is a breakup, but I think it's always hard."
It was really hard three years ago when I broke up with my girlfriend .,"If you want to cry, you can cry. I'll bring my handkerchief."
I have been dating for a year.,The story of love is always interesting.
So I told you to go out the next day.,"Please stop by, I will be excited every day ."
"Once we had a drink together, we got close quickly.",So what happened?
"It was CC, but it broke up a little bad.","My heart hurts, why is there not as beautiful as a beautiful love?"
It is said that it broke well around.,That happened. You must be empty. Are you okay?
I broke up because there were many parts that didn't fit each other.,I think a better person will appear after being sad enough.
I was in Canada until I was sixteen years old .,"Oh, you studied abroad."
"After graduating, I studied in Australia for four years.",It must have been a really good experience. How was your study abroad?
"After graduating from college, I went to Australia.","It's hard, but I think it was rewarding. Please tell me the story."
But I have a second birth and start parenting... ah... It's so hard in the world!,You are stressed by childcare and I want to help if I have a hand .
It's different from when you have a child .,"You must be physically and mentally hard, my heart hurts."
"But I have a kid so I can't do anything, it's too hard to raise it.","Oh, I really hear my heart hurts."
"When I was in college, I drank a lot, but I like alcohol rather than drinking.",You like alcohol.
"As I got older, I had more drinking: I ate it once a day and if I eat a lot, I ate 4 bottles alone .","Proper drinking is good for your health, but you know it's harmful if it's too much?"
Now you shouldn't have beer and you need to eat a bottle of Shochu to sleep.,I'm worried that it's too hard.
It would have been 15 days since I drank the last drink and I ate 3 or 4 bottles of Shochu .,"I'm worried about you, isn't it not too hard?"
"If you drink, drink it until the end.","The more I drink, the more I drink. I'm worried that it's dangerous."
"I tend to stop people around me to stop. No, even if I drink and fall, I'm going to go?",Are you sometimes resting the liver?
I think I drink twice a week - about half a bottle of Soju every time you eat?,Wouldn't it be a habit if you drink alcohol every day?
But I can't stop drinking.,"If you can't do this week alone, it's a good idea to get help from the surrounding or experts ."
I like to drink.,Moderate drinking helps to relieve stress.
"Since I was young, I've been drinking a lot.",I like drinking.
"I'm next to me, so I look alike. The drinker is done.",I think some sobriety is needed for health and I'm worried.
There are many times when I drink together and I drink alone .,"If you're worried about drinking often, it's a good idea to check the calendar."
"Not long ago, I moved from Paju to Ilsan because of work.","You moved, you've done a big deal."
"There was a favorite house on Seocho-dong, so I signed a contract.",I think moving is really a lot of work. Did you finish well?
In the end I had to move.,You'll be worried about it because it's unfamiliar.
"Of course, I thought of divorce.","That happened, it's a better relationship to break up."
"I thought it was a good person, but as soon as I knew it he told me to divorce.",I hope you feel good.
"If you think about it now , you should have just ended up with a kid , but I'm a stupid too , having the second one... .","You have a baby, congratulations."
"I bought and bought a rim, there are two lines of red lines.",I always want your happiness.
The baby who was not planned in August became pregnant .,"That was, it's an unfamiliar experience."
The baby was wrong in the middle and had an abortion surgery .,Are you okay?
"Six months later, it is said that the body is so hard that it is almost the same for childbirth .","My body and mind must have been hurt a lot, and you must relax enough."
"I didn't feel depressed last year, and I felt that it lasted all the time, and I wanted to be depressed.","It's a cold, but it's not good to leave depression and I recommend consultation ."
Is this depression?,"If you are suspected of depression, don't just go over and take a test ."
"Since last year, I have been depressed.","After being tested, it will be a little easier to feel depressed or not ."
What's wrong with me?,It's better to get care or counseling rather than worrying alone .
I kept thinking about what was the problem with me.,"Everyone has a problem, whether it is big or small, and you will be able to solve it."
What is the problem with me?,"It may not be a big ideal , but I hope you discuss it with an expert ."
I live in Korea because of my husband's business and there is a new child .,You have children.
"The big kid is three, the little boy is an elementary school student .","Oh, yes, please talk more about your children."
The second is now 10 months.,"If you are worried about your child, please tell me comfortably."
A man who dated several times came home at dawn.,"Oh, yes."
My first boyfriend was 8 years older than me and it didn't work because my interest was different.,What happened?
I started to go to church with my friend a while ago .,"You have a religion, it's really strong."
"On the road, there are a lot of evangelism from a strange religious group.","If you have a religion, your mind seems to be comfortable."
I think the Holy Spirit will take a test for me.,You are very faithful.
Then I got a job last year.,Okay. Vocational activities are important parts.
I have been to Samsung Electronics now.,That's why.
"I work as a magazine reporter, but everything else is fine.",How about working?
"At the end of last year, I was very stressed about whether or not to invite the company.","If you are stressed a lot, I think it's a worthy story ."
But it's hard to quit suddenly.,I think it's not a bad choice to rest for a while .
I told my mother that I couldn't do anything because of the restaurant work .,You must have a lot of worry and I hope you make a good choice .
Then I went today and gave me a pile of work like a pile of work?,It would be really hard to have a lot of work.
"Keep doing hard and hard work for me, and if you rest for a while, you wipe it off.",There's a lot of work and a lot of stress. Take care of your body.
"I had a lot of work these days, it's almost at the end of the second quarter...","If you are busy, you will be tired of your mind."
"If you want to be a little hard, you quit the company and move to another place .","I don't think you are yet looking for a good place , don't worry too much ."
I think it's going to go to the company for three months.,You will be able to move to a better place.
I do the interior work before my marriage .,"Congratulations on reinstatement, it must be a lot awkward."
"I was lucky to come back to the company , fortunately.",How about working again?
This Monday I'm going back to work again.,"You start working again, fighting."
"But as I went to it, I thought there was no advantage in this company and I think I'm too damaged.","I don't think there is a perfect job, it would be hard to feel a lot ."
"I talked to my mom while holding up, but now I quit and find my job.","It may be tired for a while, how about traveling nearby?"
I'm tired of going to work and I wonder if I will do it too...,I need a break.
"The problem was that I started working after I got a job, so I was so different from what I thought.",You have a lot of trouble because you are not interested in your work. How about slowly preparing for a move?
Too many chores... There is no satisfaction in work.,"If you do something that doesn't fit, you'll be really painful."
"Even if you don't eat, you can't do it if you are stressed by the company .",You have a lot of work stress and in that case I really want to run away .
"It was a bit of stress at that time, the company is so tight.",I think trivial things are piled up and angry. What happened?
I was stressed at work and wanted to buy it.,"You are worried, are you taking a break properly?"
"Work life is not very problematic, I think it is a successful life .",I'm glad you don't have much stress.
I've been working for five years now and work is good.,There is no big problem in your work life and I'm really glad.
What I do now is really simple.,I spend a lot of time a day and it's really hard to work because I'm tired of work.
"Continue to see the monitor screen, check, check...",I think it's really hard when things are repeated. Please cheer up.
For about 2 years since I moved to the company now?,"Oh, yes, you moved your job."
"The salary is a little longer and the treatment is good, so I moved to the company now.",Do you like a new job?
"As I moved to the company, my position has risen, and now I'm exaggerated.","It's a new environment, so I need to adapt."
I can't work anymore... Eventually I left and came out of the company.,"You quit work, sometimes you need a break."
"In the end, I said I would quit first.","You can get a better job, don't be so discouraged ."
I resigned last Monday because I didn't want to help even if I was here anymore.,"After you rest enough, you will be able to have a better job."
I'm talking to the manager nurse.,It's best to rest when you're bad.
I'm still on parental leave.,"It's best for your health to work, you chose well."
"I don't like everything and I want to hit you right now, but the team leader continued to take a leave of absence .",Health is a priority.
My homeroom teacher went to Sango because it was faster to get to the school than just going to the humanities .,I think people with dreams are really cool.
"I worked towards accounting at the company, but when I worked, I wouldn't be promoted if I didn't go to college .",It's nice to see that you are worried about the future.
The public officials are the best these days and the pension also comes out .,"You said, you can find the right job."
I didn't want to do it and I wanted to get a job quickly.,You said it's really nice to make money.
I wanted to make money quickly... I graduated from appeal and got a job right away .,You said that labor is really rewarding.
"I really can't ... When I wanted to , I was now contacted by the company .","You said, How was your going to work?"
"After graduating from college, I played tired for a year.",It's hard to get a job these days...
"All the other kids are getting a job, but I'm still a job.","I will hear good news soon, don't let go of hope."
"After graduating from college, I have been preparing for a job for three years .","If you prepare step by step, you will be contacted by the company you wanted , I believe that ."
It's hard to get a job...,I think it's really hard to find a good job .
"Eventually, I'm looking for work again in a nursing home .","After all, you will have a place that is right for you."
I graduated with English and it's too hard to get a job .,"Even if it's a little hard now, hold on a little, you will hear good news ."
It was a healthy kid without pain.,"You're worried about your friend's problem, please keep telling me."
"Yesterday I met a friend in a neighborhood, but you asked if you were still in Australia .","My friend's problem is always difficult, if you tell it, it will be fine."
I always have three friends.,"Okay. If you keep talking, you will see a solution."
I'd rather have time to go to school because my friends can't see it often .,"You have a lot of trouble with your relationship with your friend, would you please talk more?"
It's hard to contact my friends.,"I think I feel that feeling, but if you always have a good time, you may be bad."
What a friend is... It's just formal.,There will be a new relationship that will be as close as it is far away .
"Not long ago, I was really betrayed by him.","There is nothing hard to be betrayed by a person who believed, but you must have a lot of trouble ."
I was betrayed by a friend who was close to high school .,I was really shocked. Why don't you change your mood for a while?
I was close to my family history and was betrayed for a moment .,It is never wrong to give up faith. cheer up.
"My family and friends are in Japan , but there is no one to talk about even if it is hard .","Are you okay, is it me?"
There are only people I know.,"I am always in this place, please tell me "
"I go well with women, but I don't have a same sex friend .",I am ready to hear your story at any time.
I have no habit.,"You must have been very upset, are you okay now?"
"Have you ever paid attention to your kids, have you ever noticed when you came late and what did you do so well if I said it was hard?","You must have been upset, but your thoughts are more important than others."
Did you play with your wife?,"Conflicts are always difficult, if you keep telling me, I'll think about it together ."
It's too wasteful to take two hours to go to school .,Many things happen in school. Please keep telling me 
I think it's more like that.,That happened at school. Next?
High school came out.,"You said, please keep talking."
"When I was in high school, I was very good with my friends, but I had a bad relationship with my teacher .",The person who needs to protect the student is the teacher and it must have been really hard.
But I think my homeroom teacher doesn't like me.,"If you do that, you're really upset, so what happened next?"
"I'm also sleepy in all the other kids, but I just say why I only sleep.","You must have been really worried, I understand that heart."
"I didn't go to school well, so I had a lot of classes.",Why did you not go to school?
"Originally, the school was a bit spacious .","If there's a hard reason, school is really hard to go."
I registered at school and rarely went out.,"You have a hard time, if you tell me more, it will make you feel comfortable ."
"In middle school, the same boys of the same class were bullied, I only played with the girls, but I didn't deserve it .","You must have been hard, but that is not your fault."
I've been bullied since I was a middle school student .,"You have a hard time, if you tell me, I'll think about it together."
I was bullied in high school.,"You must have been hurt, but I love and love you the most in this world."
Eventually I quit school.,Not all learning is only at school!
I also quit school.,"I respect all your choices, it will be a great choice."
I dropped out when I was in high school .,"If you look far away, you might be better."
I want to continue studying and get a doctor?,I think I have to learn for a lifetime. So what happened next?
I am taking a special children's curriculum for kindergarten .,Okay. Studying is always difficult and difficult.
I think at that time I received all kinds of private education .,"It's hard to study, I don't like studying very much, of course, except learning about you!"
My grades have been worse since last year .,"It must have been really hard, but grades are not all of life."
I have a bad head.,"It's hard if the results are not good , but that's not the criterion for evaluating you ."
You have to study twice as many as others.,I'm upset if the results do not come out as much as I tried. I understand enough.
"I studied alone and my grades were good, but there was a lack of feeling compared to my friends .",It's amazing! You are really good.
"I managed to study, so I went to a decent school.",Everything is the result of you - that's great!
"In the middle school, grades were always the top .",You were very good at studying and it's really great!
"When I was in school, it was a whole school.","Wow, it's amazing!"
I asked me a problem that my friends never knew .,"It will be a happy memory for you, I hope you will be happy and you are happy ."
"There were many times when I was in school, but I studied hard because I dreamed.",I hope that your future will be happy and happy as much as that good result.
So it's completely upset.,That's why: what happened next?
"Where did you live, what did you wear, what did you eat, what did you do?","Huh, so? I'm curious about the back story!"
I was in the neighborhood next to it.,"Wow, really? So what happened after that?"
"Fortunately, the surgery went well... This is good.",I'm really glad you are okay now.
It wasn't hard these days.,You will be able to keep well in the future !
"After that, there was no big problem, I still.","Thank God, you can have your heart comfortably as you do now."
Then I didn't forget it again now.,I'm really glad you do it a little less.
"So I talked about this, but thanks to that the real symptoms have been reduced.",I'm relieved that it's okay.
"I don't know if it is because of the consultation, but I can't hear the depression and I can't hear it.","If you are having a hard time, please talk about it again."
Is it about seven years when it first appeared?,"It would be really hard to have the symptoms, I understand."
"Tomorrow would be a little better, I wanted to be a little better tomorrow.",Why don't you take a little more heart?
I'm still not going.,Okay. You must have a lot of trouble. Why don't you try it in a different way?
There is nothing particularly stressed.,"It can be for no reason, I understand enough."
It's not particularly something.,There may be a problem without anything. are you okay. I can.
Who bothers at school... There is no such thing.,"If nothing special, this problem will pass in a decent direction!"
"I think it's okay to make a mistake, but I don't think it's okay.",Are you okay? Small efforts are gathered to make great results.
So I tried to stay alone and to stay alone.,"You are good enough, let's try to try little by little."
"It doesn't happen, I didn't do it, but it's not good.","I can help you, all your work will be good."
"To calm down somehow, it was useless to take a deep breath.","It's important to try it, you did well enough."
"There's a candle, I buy it too... But it was no use.","If you have difficulty doing it alone, I can help you."
"I tried to eat comfortably, but it didn't work well...",I always have me next to you and I will help you.
I didn't think about alcohol on purpose and went to a night gym and exercised like crazy.,"Really good! If you try hard, you will definitely have good results ."
It's good to do light exercise... To exercise.,"It's great to exercise yourself, you are great!"
I deliberately overworked my body and almost stunned myself .,Light exercise is good when you have too complicated your head.
"I just wanted to rest at home, so I went home early and rested that day .",Sufficient rest is vitality of the day.
I rested all day at home.,Rest for the next stage is also a necessary process.
"If it was hard, it would be better to sit and rest for a while.","If you rest a little, you'll definitely get better."
The chest is also frustrating.,It must have been really hard: Did you go to the hospital?
"When I wake up, my chest is frustrating as if someone is pressing above.",It's not as hard as the chest. How about medical care?
It's frustrating as if I put a stone on my chest...,Is there a physical problem or is there a difficult thing?
"Even though I remain still, my chest trembles...",Are you nervous?
I play three times a week .,"Shall we stop for a while and take a deep breath? Slowly, one, two."
"If you keep thinking about it, your heart is thumping.","If your heart trembles, you will be nervous. Try a little calm."
I work at a company and suddenly my heart is painful.,It must have been really hard: have you ever received a hospital treatment?
"Originally, I had a little hurt.","Suddenly, if your chest hurts, it's hard. I understand enough."
My name was so sick that I was lying on the floor and barely woke up .,Is there any other problem? We recommend treatment.
Isn't it a big illness?,"If you're so worried, you can go to the hospital and get a clear diagnosis ."
Should I go to the hospital?,"If you divide it in half, it will be relieved. Don't worry too much."
What's wrong with my body?,It is better to keep your health when you are healthy. Let's go together to the hospital and get a survey .
Sometimes I just want to defeat people.,"When you're too angry, it's a good idea to choose a breath."
I caught anything in my hand and was frustrated.,"It's hard to get upset, but why don't you stop for a while and look back on the situation?"
I think I should first hit me before someone hits me .,"But after that, you may be hurt."
Suddenly I couldn't breathe and opened my eyes and immediately went to the emergency room because my head was going to die .,It's really hard when a panic attack comes. Have you ever had a hard time?
The first panic attack was around last year .,"If you are stressed out, you can. I'll think about it together."
Later I found out that it was a panic attack .,"It must have been very hard, but I'm always by my side and I will help you."
"I went to Facebook while I was Alba, but I had a little bit of writing to me.","Wow, really? Is it real?"
"I've been thinking about twenty times, but I think my story is right.","Okay, what happened then?"
Didn't you follow me to protect me?,But maybe not?
"You have to get up at 8 o'clock to take a morning class, but you can't get up unless you wake up .","If the reality is too hard, you may sleep for a long time. Have you ever had a hard time?"
What if you fall in place... I sleep in the morning.,Too much sleep is not good for your health. How about reducing a little bit?
And I drove for more than 12 hours for a day.,"If you have a lot of trouble, you can sleep too much."
And I think my memory keeps falling these days.,"Are you okay, I often forgot!"
"When you work, hold a cup in your hand and find where you are... I don't think it is serious because this is not once or twice.","Anyone can, but if you think it's too bad, it's good to get help ."
But I keep forgetting well from a month or two. It's basic to hold it in your hand.,Why don't you try to remember the small ones?
"I couldn't sleep and spent a lot of time, I forgot what happened a few minutes ago and I couldn't concentrate on work .",Why don't you try to increase your time after trying to focus for a short time?
"I feel far away, should I say it's just touching my skin?","Are you okay, it can be enough."
I don't think it's getting better and it's hard to concentrate on one place.,It must be really hard and it is also good to get help from the hospital.
But the next day I don't remember at all.,"If you are shocked, you may not remember well. I'll listen to it."
"Before I went to the hospital, I was treated, but I don't remember the details.",Are you okay? Anyone can. Are you okay now?
"I know you came to your parents' house, but I didn't know where to go .","If you do so often, why don't you get a hospital examination?"
"Five days ago, I got up at dawn and went to the bathroom and lost my mind.",That. You must have been shocked. Are you okay now?
"I woke up at dawn and went to the bathroom, but suddenly my strength was loosened and thumped and fell.","Huh, it was dangerous. Have you been to the hospital?"
I'm a laundry under the sofa and was stunned for a while .,It was almost a big day. Where did you not get hurt?
"My friend was relieved that there was a subway motion sickness, but I almost fainted it .","In that situation, it's really dizzy. Are you okay now?"
I felt like I was stunned.,It was a really dangerous situation. Are you usually bad?
I thought I was stunned.,It must have been very hard. Where are you injured?
I don't like many people.,"It can be enough, if you are too uncomfortable, you don't have to meet."
I didn't go out of motivation and I contacted people slowly.,"Are you okay, I'm always there!"
"I don't have to match the people, so I go alone.",You have been stressed and you can tell me to me .
I don't say a word... I didn't want to lose first.,"Yes, but sometimes silence is a medicine, but sometimes it can be poisonous ."
I don't talk well with each other.,"I understand enough, if you don't say it, no one knows."
"I don't say a word, and I'm chewing all the katok.",Conversation is the best way to understand your opponent - how about a little courage?
"It's not something when I work, but I'm nervous because my chest is excited.","You've been nervous, why don't you take a deep breath for a while?"
"Since then, my heart is just excited, even if you press it with your hands to calm down...","I'm nervous with you, can I hold your hands?"
"The heart is just pounding, but I couldn't sit like this.","When you're too excited, take a very slow breath and spit out."
"Insomnia has become a bit worse these days, but I can't get enough sleep, so my heart is unpleasant.","In that case, it's hard for me to sleep. Are you okay now?"
"My body is really tired, but I can't sleep. If you lie down, it keeps turning and your heart is pounding.",There are many causes of pounding - why don't you take an examination?
"Yesterday I couldn't sleep, so I couldn't sleep because my heart was pounding.","If you are nervous, you may be excited and may not fall asleep. Shall we bring your heart comfortably?"
"But from ten days ago, the goal is sore.",Appropriate amounts of painkillers can help.
"In the evening, my head hurts the most.",It must be really hard. Why don't you take a walk for a while?
I think someone has a rock on top.,"Even if you have a lot of trouble, you can have a headache."
I can't sleep because I have a headache in the evening .,It's really painful to have a sticky head. Are you okay now?
"I turned around until dawn because of the headaches, but when the sun rises, I fall asleep.",How about taking painkillers?
"I was prescribed Atiban, but my head hurts and I was drunk, and I slept for only two hours.","In that case, you can take a walk for a while."
"From then on, I can't do anything because my body is so sad.","You have a trembling thing, why don't you take a deep breath for a while?"
"I can't meet my parents' eyes, I don't have anything wrong, but I'm so nervous.","If you are too nervous, it will be helpful to think different for a while ."
"I trembled and opened the door, kneeled and sprouted. I was wrong.","If you are so nervous, you can't do anything, I'll be next to me, so relax."
"I'm not doing a lot of night work at the company, why am I so tired?","I think you're too busy, why don't you look back for a while?"
"If you sleep a lot, you are tired as you sleep , if you sleep less, you are tired as you sleep .",It must be really hard. How about doing light exercise?
"Even if I move a little, I quickly feel tired, so I feel a small life radius.",Walking with clear air is also good for fatigue.
"It's not particularly bad, but it's not good.",Isn't it a problem with digestion? We recommend a hospital examination .
"Especially if you lie down at night, it's weird.","It's uncomfortable. If you take a deep breath, you can be a little easier."
"Even if you are in an empty stomach, it may be bad, but you didn't eat it at all.",It's really hard if it's not good. Why don't you go to the hospital?
There is no reason to live.,"I am happy to be, but I hope you are happy."
I want to live the same thing with others.,Why don't you make something fun yourself?
It doesn't make sense to live.,How about doing light exercise? Walk is also good!
"I was just at home when I was on vacation , nothing...","The house is really comfortable and good, but it's hard to be inside."
"I don't want to do anything, so I'm stuck at home as soon as I end .",It is easy when the first is difficult. Go out and play together!
I think most of the day is lying down.,"How about going out from nearby: the entrance, the supermarket in front of the house and the far away!"
I don't have any energy and I don't want to do it. There's nothing like a desire...,It's really hard if you don't have any motivation - why don't you try small things?
I don't want to do anything because there is no energy from January and I am not motivated.,"If you get up now and do anything small, the result is left. Let's try it."
I don't have any willingness to do it and I have no energy.,"It can't always be powerful, it may be time to rest now. cheer up!"
I remember threatening to let you taste hell and keep thinking about hitting and hitting.,"If you continue to worry about the same, you will only have the same result. Take a breath for a while."
I don't have any other thoughts these days .,How about thinking about something else to forget that thought?
I think I missed it for some reason...,"It must be really hard, I hope something happier and more enjoyable ."
I can't forget the situation at that time.,"It's hard to forget it easily, it must be really hard, I understand enough."
"If you close your eyes, your husband's hand like a pot lid is just flying.","It's harder because it's hard to forget hard work, but next to you is always."
The man's scary eyes... I keep on my eyes.,Remember that I can help you every time you think about it .
Keep checking if the desk drawer is closed and the door is definitely locked .,"I often check anything repeatedly, it can be enough."
I don't keep checking it repeatedly.,I think it's okay if you are not too tired or hard.
I feel like I'm going to go.,"Anyone can make a mistake, give you a chance to make a mistake ."
"If people don't listen well, I'll keep talking about my story repeatedly.","I have to do that too, but why don't you respect the thoughts of others a little bit more?"
"I said what I said and if the other person was so lukewarm or if the answer was cool, I would say again.","That's really hard, how about thinking about my words too?"
It is conscious to talk repeatedly.,The explanation does not always cause understanding and it would be good to give you time to understand yourself .
"When I leave work, I do the paragraph, but I usually check the door 3 times 4 times.","You're worried about making mistakes, but anyone can make a mistake ."
"Since last summer, I have to check the gates and trunks.",I think it's not bad if you don't get stressed while checking.
"Especially when I went out, I kept checking the door of the house.",Why don't you set the margin line? Check and finish it only three times!
I wash my hands often.,"It must be really hard, why don't you leave a compulsion a little bit?"
I think I wash my hands more than 30 times a day .,"Huh, but your hands are really clean!"
It was washed so much that I had housewife eczema .,"It's not bad to be neat, but if you have a hard time, it's a good idea to have a little bit of your mind."
"After that, every time I leave work, check many times if it has been turned off properly.","It's good to be sure of anything, but if you are stressed, why don't you take a little bit of time?"
I have to keep checking it repeatedly.,"The meticulous thing is good, how about checking it a little less? You are perfect."
Did you give it to the puppy? Did you organize the bathroom? Did the gas lock? I check it every time I think .,"You're really meticulous, but don't be too stressed!"
The seizure symptoms seem to come once every half a year .,It must have been really hard. Are you okay now?
It was okay... I played intermittently.,You must have been very difficult; do you have any health problems?
I was drinking water for a while and I had seizure symptoms and lasted about an hour .,"Huh, really? How is your condition now?"
"Originally I slept as soon as I touched my head, but now I can't sleep, so I keep turning around at 5 am .","It's not as hard as sleeping; if it's too hard, why don't you take a walk for a while?"
I don't remember when I slept.,"When I can't sleep too much, I wake up and read a book, how about doing something else?"
That's how much money I saved... If you think about work then you can't sleep.,"The body is tired, but if you can't sleep, it's really hard. Sometimes it is also good to get the help of a hospital or someone else ."
"Yesterday I lie down to sleep, but I was anxious because I thought something would happen while I was sleeping. I can't sleep.",There is an uneasy thing: Would it be a bit more comfortable if you told me?
It's hard to fall asleep because I'm anxious.,"Even if you are worried, please remember that I am always by my side ."
I can't sleep and I'm anxious...,"In fact, half of the worry of doing now will not happen. Don't be too nervous!"
"When you lie down at night, you will get all the stars.","It's not as hard as sleeping, why don't you empty your thoughts a bit?"
"When I go to bed, I only feel useless.",You can put down all worry or complex thoughts as much as you sleep.
"If you think about it, it's time to go.","If you have a lot of thoughts, it's hard to sleep and it's okay to worry for a while ."
"I had a stress, but there was nothing else except to install a little.","It's really hard if you have a lot of stress, why don't you find a way to resolve it?"
"I kept getting stress, but I couldn't sleep properly.",It must have been a lot of hard work because you couldn't sleep. How about eating a little comfortable mind?
"Anyway, I couldn't sleep well if it was stressful.","You have a hard time, I want to listen to the burden together."
I dreamed a lot and was surprised by the small sound.,"If you sleep, you wake up so well Let's create an environment where you can get a good night's sleep ."
"Even if you fall asleep hard, it is hard to wake up in the middle and fall asleep again.",It's really hard to sleep well and I hope you can get a good night's sleep .
Sometimes I'm sensitive to sleep.,"Why don't you try items that help you sleep well, such as earplugs and eye patches?"
I kept sleeping and waking up at dawn and I had a feeling that I didn't sleep for a few years .,"It would have been really hard to keep sleeping, how about getting help from the hospital?"
"Even though I was prescribed insomnia, it didn't work much.","You must be very tired, why don't you look for the root cause?"
"If you keep blowing, you are doing it.",There is nothing hard to sleep and I hope you can sleep well.
"Even if you sleep, it wasn't refreshing.",I think it's more tired than I can sleep at all. Why don't you get the help of a doctor?
I can't sleep ... so I'm tired and tired .,I think it is necessary to sleep for people and I hope you have a good night's sleep .
"I don't think I sleep, it's like a sick chicken during the day .","You must be really tired, how about sleeping well for about a day?"
"My menstruation didn't come out for two months, but I went over it.","If you have a health problem, your menstrual cycle can be irregular . How about going to the hospital?"
But I don't have menstruation since I went to the ski resort .,You must have a lot of worry: why don't you get a test for a problem?
Menstruation is not regular.,"If you are stressed, it may be. Please tell me if you have a hard time ."
My husband became stronger.,It will be a positive change! I always support you.
"I didn't do it originally, I was always full of confidence and it was a very positive personality .",There must have been a reason why you have to change your personality.
"Originally, I had a very good affinity.","You said, but it would have been. I always believe in you."
"But suddenly I wanted to do it, I looked for a porno and I tried masturbation for the first time.","It's natural enough, there's nothing weird about it!"
"Masturbation for the first time alone, I think I'm going to have a sexual desire.","Everyone is, it's not strange at all."
For the first time I've been masturbating.,"You said, but it's a natural desire for everyone."
Since when? I don't think digestion is good.,"The digestive function is not good, how about eating well-digested foods?"
"When I was 8 years old, I ate all my meals and my brother .","It would have been really hard to be bloated, how about eating digestive agents?"
I always have a lot of stomach.,I think it's good to get help in the hospital.
I bought it because I bought it.,It's really hard to get sick. Are you okay now?
"But after eating it, it's too bitter.",That must have been really sick. How about eating less irritating food above?
"Once I was bitter, I woke up at dawn and my husband sleeps so peacefully .",I don't think it's as painful as the heartburn - why don't you go to the hospital?
My eyes are getting worse.,"You can't see it well, why don't you go to the hospital?"
"Even if you wear glasses, you can wear a lens... I don't know what to do.","If your eyesight falls, it can, don't worry too much and go to the hospital!"
"Then I woke up and I didn't think much, but since then I can't see my eyes well.","Suddenly, if you can't see it well, it's embarrassing enough. I understand."
I don't want to eat because my mouth is rough...,Are you stressed out? It's too hard to have an appetite.
I felt like chewing on the sand and I just drank coffee.,You can't skip your meals - eat little by little .
About 5-6 cups a day? The inside is not bitter.,It's really hard because you don't have a taste. Can you tell me what it is?
For 5 days I could not eat properly and I almost slept .,"Both meals and sleep are important, but I'm really worried. Are you okay now?"
"Since that day, I can't sleep well or eat well.",Are you stressed? You can consult with me!
There is no rice taste... I can't sleep deeply.,"I think there is a hard time, I always wait for you here, please tell me when it is comfortable."
The appetite dropped and 3 kilometers a month fell out at once.,Are you not on a diet? I'm worried about you.
"I didn't have a taste, so I had only six cups of coffee a day, so I lost 6kg.",Excessive weight loss is not really good for your health - why don't you look for a taste?
The appetite has fallen.,"I think it's really hard, can I help?"
"I sit in the middle of the room and take a class, but my neck is so nervous that my head will fall off.",Do you have any health problems and how about going to the hospital?
"Three years ago I listened to the lecture in the classroom, but suddenly my throat doesn't get out.",It must have been really hard. Are you okay now?
"Three years ago, more than 500 people gathered and listened to the lectures .","If you have a bad degree, you may want to go to the hospital ."
I'm walking in my dreams in the daytime and suddenly the two men grabbed my arms and dragged my mouth and put it on the trunk .,"Huh, you must have been really surprised, so next?"
"Then what's a lung building, and you come to me with a top.",Nightmare is really hard at any time. Are you okay now?
"When I open my eyes, I see my arms cut in my eyes.","It's a really scary dream, but that's just a dream, so it's okay now!"
"If you don't drink a day, it's empty.","If you rely on something, you have to be dragged to it later - why don't you break it little by little?"
"If you wake up, drink again, it's repeat.","It's hard at first, but it's getting used to it and it would be better to reduce it little by little every day ."
I really drink a lot of alcohol? Almost to the level of addiction.,Alcohol is only a temporary avoidance - you are already strong even if you don't avoid it .
"If you have a water tree, the blood is directed to your head, feeling that will continue all the time?",It's really hard to be dizzy. Are you okay now?
I was showering yesterday if I was so stressed that I was just dizzy and dizzy .,"If suddenly you are dizzy, I really can't do anything. Didn't you get hurt?"
Feeling like you're drinking like a drink? So it came out in the middle and I think it will fall if there is more...,"Huh, are there no health problems? Are you okay?"
"After taking a leave of absence, I stayed at home .","You don't have to do something you don't want to do, but if you go out, you'll have a lot more fun ."
Not going well... I went out only when I needed something very often .,"If you feel a sense of stability at home, it's okay, but there are many joys to get outside the house."
"The symptoms improved and worsened, but last year I couldn't come out of bed for three months .","Are you stressed out? If you are okay, you can tell me to me."
"After lunch, I go to the bathroom to clean it and I'm worried about what's happening .","Huh, if you hear Tinnitus, it's hard to have everyday life. Are you okay now?"
The heart pounding sounds in my ears. I'm going crazy.,Why don't you go to the hospital to find out the cause?
"There's nothing, but I keep hearing the sound of flying in the ear?",I think it's harder because I can't do it myself because I understand it enough.
I feel like another in me?,"Huh, it's really unfamiliar, are you okay now?"
I feel strange in the mirror.,"If you have a bad degree, you may want to find a hospital ."
Sometimes I feel not me.,"You must have been embarrassed, but now you are talking with me. Are you okay?"
I think there are a lot of mistakes in trivial things .,Are you okay? Anyone can.
"Even when I talk to my friends, the words don't come up well.","If you don't think well, it's good to take a break."
Cognitive ability seems to have fallen.,"You must have been embarrassed, but you don't have to think about it too much."
I drew my wrist in a hazy spirit to die.,"You've done really hard work, are you okay now?"
I drank a lot of alcohol at home and climbed to the roof.,"You've been very painful, don't forget that I am always next to you."
"I was so nervous that I couldn't work properly even if I went to work, it was so painful to damage the people around me, so I tried to commit suicide .",I'm so glad to see you again.
I thought I couldn't do me.,"I respect all your thoughts, but I'm worried. If you have a hard time, you can tell me."
So I drew my arm with a cutter knife.,"You must have something really painful, are you okay now?"
"When I felt the pain, I didn't think it was a strange idea, so I used to go to a scab until it was bleeding .",It's so sad that you hurt yourself so much in the world.
"Yesterday my hands and feet were suddenly numb and I felt like it would be paralyzed again, so I ate calcium.","If the blood circulation is not good, it is said to be numb. Let's have a simple massage."
Then my hands and feet are starting to get around.,Light stretching every day is good for blood circulation .
"I sat in the center as usual, but after I sat down for 10 minutes? After about 20 minutes, my hands and feet were around.",It must have been quite uncomfortable. Are you okay now?
No one at home... I thought I might just die there.,Such fear is really scary. Is there any problem now?
Too hard... I wanted to scream like this.,"You must be really scared, I understand that heart."
"I seemed to die because I was sleepy, too scary...",It was really big and I'm glad to see you again.
Then I felt like I was dying as soon as I couldn't breathe .,"Suddenly, if you don't breathe, it's really scary. Are you okay now?"
So I sat on the couch for a while and picked it up. I think I'm going to die.,You must be really scared and I will be helpful from the side.
"I was so cold that I opened the window, but I seemed to die.","Is there any problem now? If you still have the symptoms, why don't you go to the hospital?"
"And every moment, the mind is sold in different ways? I have to concentrate at this moment... I feel like my head.",There are times when you can't concentrate well and in that case it's good to do something else for a while .
"I don't do it on purpose, but I feel that something else flows into my head?",How about focusing on small things? I listen to you for a while now!
You shouldn't say that if you keep hovering in your head and try to write it down .,Meditation is good in concentration - why don't you try it?
But I think I have health.,"It's really hard if you lose your stamina , why don't you usually do a simple exercise ?"
"The weight is the same, but the health is very low.",Health is the basis of all activities. Should I try to stretch for a while?
It's hard to keep my stamina.,Didn't you need a break? Appropriate rest is a great vitality .
Then I lost 6kg.,"Even if you lose weight, you are not good for your health."
"I couldn't sleep properly, I was anxious and I was eating rice, so I lost 6kg.",Isn't there a health problem in your health? How about going to the hospital if it is an overdose?
Then I lost more than 10kg and everyone was surprised to start.,"Suddenly, if you lose weight, you will be hard. I like the right!"
"The amount of moving is reduced, so I gained a lot of weight.",It is said that the proper weight gain is fine if it is not too hard to health .
Weighs also increases.,"If your weight gains a lot in the short term, it is not good for your health ."
I repeated it over and over 10 kilometers in a year.,Do you have any health problems? Why don't you go to the hospital?
"I was in a bad condition since I ride the gyrodlop in the amusement park , is it because the organs take gravity badly?",Isn't it time to rest? Take a breath for a while.
The body is sinking all day.,"You must be really tired, sleeping today."
It's as heavy as it is on the leg.,"If the poor condition lasts for a long time, it is not good for your health and I think it is good to get help from the hospital ."
"If you fix one place, it's sick.","The pain was severe. If you are too sick, why don't you go to the hospital?"
I will die.,It must have been really hard. Are you sick now?
"A few days ago, I was just watching TV at home.",There is nothing as painful as pain. Do you still have pain?
It hurts so much.,"If your neck hurts, it's hard to move and it's too hard. Are you okay now?"
It hurts so much that I can't turn my neck.,"You must be really sick, if it's too bad, why don't you go to the hospital?"
"Rather, it's okay when sitting, but if you lie down, your neck becomes worse.","If you keep paying attention, your body is nervous and it will be harder."
I think the pain is around the whole body.,"It must have been very hard, is the pain still going on?"
I'm going to die because my whole body is squeezed.,There's nothing as painful as why don't you get treatment?
There is no place where you can't get sick.,It must have been really hard and instead I want to hurt.
"The doctor gave me an injection, it's good, but this time my back is sick.","If your back hurts, it's hard to sit or lie down."
"My back hurts a lot, so I can't move well.",It must have been really hard: why don't you get the help of a doctor?
"If you lie down or lie on your side, it's okay, but your back hurts because you sleep.",I think it's harder if the waist is the center of the human body. Are you okay now?
My head is now as heavy and painful as I press one side .,"Ugh, it's really hard if your head hurts. I really understand that heart."
I feel like I'm pushing a manhole cover on my head and pressing it.,"Instead, I want to hurt you, are you okay now?"
I think it's hitting a hot nail with a hammer in the right temple .,"If your head hurts, it's really painful, why don't you try a painkiller?"
"I ate it at dawn, so I ate it, so I ate it.","Anything is overpaid, it's not good to eat too much food ."
"Even if it doesn't taste, I eat it later if I don't eat it.","Then I'm worried that I will hurt, why don't you reduce a little bit?"
"If you eat like that at dawn, you don't want to go to the company.","Why don't you take a small habit? If you are full, let's just put the spoon down!"
"I have a new employee in the company and I don't notice it, and I forgot to teach you one... There is no answer.",How about releasing stress in a different way?
"Since then, I think I've been releasing stress by eating .",Binge eating does not resolve fundamental stress .
I think I've been relieved by eating since July .,"I'm worried about throwing it down, why don't you take a quick walk by relieving stress?"
I'm so tired these days .,"If you are tired, it's hard to do anything. Why don't you take a break?"
So I was tired.,Isn't it time to take a break? Take a break 
"I'm a little tired, but I didn't get stressed.","You must be really tired, sleep tonight tonight ."
I don't think it is sleeping.,It's really hard if you can't sleep properly. Why don't you create an environment for a good night's sleep?
"I feel tired enough to be so tired, but I can't sleep.",A cup of warm milk is said to be helpful for a good night's sleep .
Did you sleep for four hours yesterday?,You must be really tired and I hope you can sleep well today .
Everyone seems to see my chest.,"It's really hard when you feel like that, wouldn't it be comfortable to have different thoughts?"
"If you are talking about kids at school, I just fought my swearing.",I think I know what I feel and I think it's a good idea to think a little bit different.
I think the teacher hates me and looks at the case.,It must be really hard and I will help you next to you.
I'm still watching.,"You will be really stressed, why don't you ask someone to help you?"
My husband is lying and is not able to meet me where I went far away .,It would be too hard to think of someone watching me and I want to be helpful.
"I can't spend my money, count and monitor every money in my wallet .",I don't care as much as being watched. Are you still in that situation?
"When your husband has a meeting with friends, you can't get out of the house early.",Are you being watched? It must be really hard.
"I don't ask where I spend the money, but I think I check my wallet once when I don't have a husband .",You must be really difficult: How about having a conversation once?
My husband loves me so much that I watch every moment.,"If the degree is severe, why don't you get the help of the police or the hospital?"
I think my husband is spending money on my mother .,It's a really hard situation and I want to be comfortable.
"I bring about 3 million won for living expenses... When I think about it, I don't talk about how much I earn.",It would be hard and I'll help you if you need to confess your worries .
"Not long ago, my brother bought a car and I think my husband secretly added money to it.","You must have had a lot of trouble, why don't you think about more for conviction?"
You have to be careful because it has a camera in each room and is eavesdropping at home .,"It must be really hard, I'll always be next to me. cheer up."
"Last time I was on the Internet, but I did what I did yesterday in the next cafe .",There's nothing more painful than being watched. I want to help.

"Originally, there was no problem in sleeping, but I woke up this morning and I can't breathe well.",I think it will be really hard if I suddenly do not breathe. Are you okay now?
"The plane rides for a long time, and I go to Russia and walk around the alpine area.","If it's too bad, why don't you go to the hospital?"
I went to the library last year and came back home.,"Try to take a deep breath, it is important to calm your breath."
I can't breathe and I'm cramped.,"You must be really frustrated, if the symptoms persist, you may want to go to the hospital ."
"My heart is cramped , breathing is too uncomfortable .","If your heart is stuffy, your life is really uncomfortable. Is the symptom still persisting?"
"When I come in at night, my chest is stuffy and I can't breathe well.","Huh, it would be really hard, are you okay now?"
"Sometimes it looks like a bug in front of you. I knew it was a real bug, but I shouted, but it was nothing.","You must have been surprised, but if you confirm that there is no actual, you will be relieved ."
Sometimes I can see the bladder.,"You must have been embarrassed, can't you see it now?"
But after that sometimes it looks in vain.,"I don't actually do it, I think it's important to control my mind."
"When I was still lying down, I heard something like a clock - I don't know exactly what it is .",I think it's harder because I can't do it. Are you okay now?
There was a sound of the second hand in the ear.,"If the degree is severe, you may want to get help from a doctor ."
"There is no place to sound anywhere, you can hear the second hand at night to sleep at night .","You must be really painful, are you psychologically anxious? You can tell me my concerns ."
"After a few hours, I didn't have the energy to go to the hospital.",It was almost a big day. Are you okay now?
It was solved all over my body.,"I think you are not very good, why don't you go to the hospital?"
"I can't even move one step, and my body is powerful...",It must have been very hard and I think you should take enough rest.
"I couldn't do it, so I was admitted to the university hospital and did a thorough examination .",You said: Are the test results good?
I just got a test.,I hope there's nothing wrong with it .
That's why I make a reservation and check it over.,I think it would be great if you could see the certain cause of the test.
But there's nothing wrong with it.,I'm glad that there is nothing wrong with it.
There's nothing wrong with the test.,"If you have symptoms later, please visit the hospital ."
"I went to the local medicine department and received a test, but there are no big abnormalities, it's similar to cancer .","It's really grateful for that, because there's nothing wrong with it."
The hospitals that are good are all visited?,Okay. What did you say in the hospital?
I went to the hospital earlier.,"You may be afraid, but I think it's a big courage just by looking for a hospital ."
"I went to the hospital and the hypotension was severe, but it was not enough to die.","You have a medical treatment, what prescription did you give me in the hospital?"
I was admitted to the hospital and was tested and there was nothing wrong with it .,I'm glad that there is nothing wrong after the test .
I don't know why I go to the hospital.,It's a good thing to say that there is no problem.
I don't know why I go to the hospital and check it out.,"The prosecutor may be scary, but you are really courageous."
So I have been in a hospital since I was in high school .,I hope the medicine is a road.
He said he should continue to take medicine in the future .,Does the medicine fit well?
I started taking medicine again.,I hope it works.
"But even though I took medicine, it wasn't better... Other hospitals have no abnormalities...","Hugh, glad."
But the funny thing is that there's nothing wrong with it - I didn't have a drop in my eyesight .,I'm glad that there is nothing wrong with it.

I think it's really worse.,"It must be really hard, are you still severe?"
But I think the symptoms are getting worse.,"If it's too bad, why not go back to the hospital again?"
I feel really anxious about my exams .,"""Ugh, exams suck, don’t they? But hey, you’ve made it this far. What’s the worst that can happen? You fail? So what? We’ll get back up and crush it next time!"
I had a fight with my best friend .,"""Oof, that’s rough. What happened? Spill the tea! Did they say something dumb or was it a misunderstanding?"""
These days I feel lonely.,"""Bro, have you seen the memes on loneliness? You’re not alone in this, but fr, wanna talk? What makes you feel this way?"""
I can’t sleep properly at night.,"""Bruh, are you scrolling reels at 3 AM again? Be honest, or is it nightmares? What keeps you up?"""
I feel like crying all the time.,"""Oh man, that’s heavy. Wanna talk about what’s been getting to you? Like a lot has been going on lately, huh?"""
I feel like no one understands me.,"""Ugh, relatable. Sometimes people just don’t get it. What happened? Someone said something dumb again?"""
